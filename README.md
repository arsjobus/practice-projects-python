# Practice Projects Python

## Message to Potential Employers:

I have professional experience in creating FastAPI Python APIs and Services, but I have mostly switched over to using Agentic AI and LLMs as a AI assisted programmer to write code faster.

Please understand, I do these practice Python programs in this repository to maintain my muscle memory so that I am always ready to write code without AI assistance.

The code within this repo may not be used to judge my actual skillset and / or use of design patterns.

## Thank you!
